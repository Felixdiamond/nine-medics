# nineMedics: Medication Reminder App

## Project Overview

The Medication Reminder App is designed to help users manage their medication schedules efficiently. It provides reminders for medication times and supports basic medication management features. The application is currently in the console application stage but is planned to evolve into a full-featured graphical user interface (GUI) application with advanced features and cloud integration.

## Current Progress

### Phase 1: Console Application (Finished)

- **Error Handling and Input Validation**: Improved for more robust user interaction.
- **Medication Editing and Deletion**: Implemented to allow modification and removal of medications.
- **Data Persistence**: Implemented addition of file I/O for storing data.

### Phase 2: Learning Qt Basics (Current Stage)
- **Set up Qt development envioronment**: Currently learning about qt and how to get started
