# nineMedics: Medication Reminder App

## Project Overview

The Medication Reminder App is designed to help users manage their medication schedules efficiently. It provides reminders for medication times and supports basic medication management features. The application is currently in the console application stage but is planned to evolve into a full-featured graphical user interface (GUI) application with advanced features and cloud integration.

## Current Progress

### Phase 1: Console Application (Current Stage)
- **Basic Medication Management**: Users can add and display medications.
- **Reminder Functionality**: Basic reminders for medication times are in place.
- **Error Handling and Input Validation**: Improved for more robust user interaction.
- **Medication Editing and Deletion**: Implemented to allow modification and removal of medications.
- **Data Persistence**: Planned addition of file I/O for storing data.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary C++ libraries installed.

2. Compile it:
```bash
g++ -o ninemedics main.cpp -pthread     
```

3. Run the executable with `./ninemedics`


### Next Steps

The next steps involve transitioning to a GUI-based application using Qt, incorporating advanced features, and exploring database and cloud integration. For detailed planning and future phases, refer to the [Roadmap](roadmap.md).
